# Restful-Blog-app

This Project is very close to me. As I have used some new libraries to work on. 

Most importantly *Schematic.ui* for awsome front-end UI and backend has enviroment dependencies included in the package.

## Such as: 

1. Express.js

2. Ejs

3. Body-parser

4. Mongoose

The system uses *mongodb* as database in the project. Looking forward that you guys have a glance over it as well. Cheers!
